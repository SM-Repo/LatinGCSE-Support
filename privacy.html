    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> 2026-02-20</p>

    <p><strong>LatinGCSE</strong> is a fully offline, on‑device app. It does not make network calls and does not require an internet connection to function.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>On‑device data only:</strong> Any data generated by your use of the app (e.g., preferences or progress, if applicable) is stored locally on your device. It is not transmitted to us.</li>
        <li><strong>Support communications:</strong> If you contact us for support, we will receive your email address and any information you include in your message.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell or share personal data with third parties. Because the app is offline and sandboxed, no personal data is sent to our servers.</p>

    <h2>Analytics and Third‑Party Services</h2>
    <p>The app does not use analytics, crash reporting, or third‑party SDKs that transmit data.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain support emails only as long as necessary to address your request, unless a longer period is required by law.</p>

    <h2>Your Choices</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You may choose not to send support emails. However, we may be unable to assist without sufficient details.</li>
        <li>You can request deletion of support emails you’ve sent us by contacting us.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>The app is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy from time to time. Material changes will be reflected by updating the effective date above.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
